Kelpie is a SIP to XMPP gateway

latest source can be found at http://www.javaforge.com/project/kelpie

It attempts to make sip endpoints appear as xmpp endpoints and vice-versa


The gateway only focuses on protocol translation, a SIP proxy (such as Kamailio) and a federated xmpp server are required for routing.


XMPP->SIP

This is the easiest case, the xmpp client adds user@{kelpie.hostname} to his contact list, this gets translated as user@{outbound.siproxy} and the proxy routes the messages

SIP->XMPP

This direction is more complicated.
The sip proxy should identify that user is actually an xmpp endpoint and forwards to the kelpie gateway.  Kelpie has a mapping of "user" to xmpp ids in its properties file,  if it is found it forwards the message to the specified xmpp server.


example:
com.voxbone.kelpie.mapping.user=user@jabber.org
would map sent to sip:user@{kelpie.hostname} to user@jabber.org


if you don't want to use the mapping file, the format
sip:user+xmpp-server@{kelpie.hostname} can also be used instead


note: this fork attempts to lookup full JIDs for user+xmpp-server calls and generates live mapping (WIP)
